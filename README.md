# Cub3D

Cub3D is a project to create a dynamic view inside a 3D maze. Using the [MiniLibX library](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), we must implement raycasting in the style of the famous [Wolfenstein 3D](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/) game, the first true FPS in videogame history.

## Clone

Clone the repository including the MiniLibX submodule:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/makiessedev/cub3D.git
```

Or:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/makiessedev/cub3D.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Compile and Run

To compile the projecto, `cd` into the cloned directory and:

```shell
make
```

To run the program:

```shell
./cub3D assets/maps/good/map.cub
```

The program takes a map file as an argument. Maps are available in the `maps` directory. There are good maps which the program should run smoothly with, and bad maps which the program should reject.
For example:

- `./cub3d maps/good/library.cub` should run.

- `./cub3d maps/bad/filetype_wrong.buc` should print an error and abort.

## Controls

Controls for movement and rotation are:

- `W`: move forward
- `S`: move backward
- `A`: strafe left
- `D`: strafe right
- `left arrow`: rotate left
- `right arrow`: rotate right
- `mouse`: rotate by moving the mouse (bonus only)
